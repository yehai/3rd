/** TMX Tiles of a tile layer. This is just a list of GIDs pointing to a specific tile in the tileset.
 The GIDs have the KTTilemapTileFlip flags encoded, so it is recommended to use the tileAt method from KTTilemapLayer
 instead of accessing the GIDs directly. 
 
 However the latter may be preferable if you need to access many GIDs consecutively, for example for pathfinding algorithms.
 And if there are no flip flags used on the pathfinding layer, you don't even need to mask out the KTTilemapTileFlip flags. */
